This is the production build of my personal website

The site is built in a private development environment using the following tools and technologies:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) as backend environment
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as a package manager
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) as a task manager
- [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) as a templating engine
- [Bootstrap V4](https://getbootstrap.com/) as the frontend framework

Once the development code is ready for deployment, I use gulp tasks to compile and minify the SCSS, JS and HTML. I also use gulp tasks to apply inline styles, pre-loading, and file conversion / compression to the production build so that the website renders on mobile and desktop at the highest speed possible. There is also a service worker, manifest and web bots handler to meet the requirements of a Progressive Web App
